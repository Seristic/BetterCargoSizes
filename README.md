## Description

This mod focuses on resizing the space that items occupy in your inventory, providing a more accurate representation of their physical dimensions.

BetterCargoSizes does not directly alter the challenge or difficulty of managing your inventory but instead aims to enhance the realism of item sizes. Some items have been adjusted to take up more or less space, ensuring that their size aligns with their real-world counterparts. This realistic approach adds an extra layer of immersion to your DayZ gameplay without compromising the core mechanics or balance of the game.
