# BetterCargoSizes

Enhance your inventory management in DayZ with BetterCargoSizes. This mod introduces realistic item resizing, allowing you to carry a broader range of supplies, equipment, and resources without compromising the challenge or immersion of the game. Enjoy a more adaptable inventory system that optimizes storage space while maintaining the intense survival experience of DayZ.

## Description

Discover a more realistic and immersive inventory management experience with BetterCargoSizes, a mod that meticulously adjusts the sizes of items in DayZ. This mod focuses on resizing the space that items occupy in your inventory, providing a more accurate representation of their physical dimensions.

BetterCargoSizes does not directly alter the challenge or difficulty of managing your inventory but instead aims to enhance the realism of item sizes. Some items have been adjusted to take up more or less space, ensuring that their size aligns with their real-world counterparts. This realistic approach adds an extra layer of immersion to your DayZ gameplay without compromising the core mechanics or balance of the game.

Whether you're organizing your supplies, looting abandoned buildings, or preparing for intense encounters, BetterCargoSizes offers a visually accurate representation of item sizes in your inventory. This mod provides a subtle yet impactful enhancement to the overall immersion and authenticity of your DayZ experience.

Please note that BetterCargoSizes is purely focused on resizing item space and does not introduce any additional gameplay changes or modifications to the core mechanics of DayZ.
